      <p><em>Graphic Designer at <strong><a href="https://bwdstrategic.com/">BWD Strategic</a></strong></em></p>
      <p>Yin is a designer and illustrator from central China. Beautiful beaches lured her to university in Australia and she’s stayed ever since. Yin’s career as professional aesthete began as a young teen with two years of intensive
        training in traditional fine arts. Today, she creates visual strategy for audiences the world over, combining the best of those early years in Beijing with the latest in contemporary Australian design.</p>
      <p>Yin is a series of the best kind of paradoxes: creative yet meticulous, traditional yet open-minded, happy at home, yet desirous to see the world.</p>
